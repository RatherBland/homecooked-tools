# homecooked-tools

Just a place for me to put tools I've developed for personal use. I encourage anyone interested to use and modify them freely.

## OSINT

 `email.py` - Automatically generate permutations of emails from a list of names.
 `hipby.py` - Query the HaveIBeenPwned database against a list of emails. Note; limited to 40 requests per minute to restrictions by the API
 

## Static Web App Analysis
An attempt at automating aspects of client facing web app analysis. Mostly useless.
EDIT: Wrote to assist with hunting clues in CTF's. 

## Sixty Second Swanson
Generates Ron Swanson quotes at sixty second intervals, pretty self explanatory. I'm using the Pushbullet API, you will need to substitute your own key if you'd like to give this a test run.
EDIT: Wrote this for fun to familiarize myself with the pushbullet API

## Earthquake Alert
Sends notifications upon the detection of an earthquake by the USGS. Original code by [Abhinav Anand](https://github.com/ab-anand/Automation-Bots/blob/master/earthquake.py).
EDIT: Wrote this for fun to familiarize myself with the pushbullet API

# homecooked-tools

Just a place for me to put tools I've developed for personal use. I encourage anyone interested to use and modify them freely.

## Static Web App Analysis
An attempt at automating aspects of client facing web app analysis. Mostly useless.

## Sixty Second Swanson
Generates Ron Swanson quotes at sixty second intervals, pretty self explanatory. I'm using the Pushbullet API, you will need to substitute your own key if you'd like to give this a test run.

## Earthquake Alert
Sends notifications upon the detection of an earthquake by the USGS. Original code by [Abhinav Anand](https://github.com/ab-anand/Automation-Bots/blob/master/earthquake.py).
